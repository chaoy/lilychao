<h1>Hi, thanks for using this theme!</h1>
<p>Pixel is a free template to use with the <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> CMS. It features a 2-3 columns layout and sports the following goodies: dropdown top menu for categories; customizable feedburner field (optional, requires feedburner ID); widgets all around (6 positions); footer navigation and a transparent look. The divisions are also all made to fit standard ad formats and the welcome message on top right can also be customized through the admin panel, no need to mess into the code.</p>
